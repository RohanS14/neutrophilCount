This repository provides code for a research project using Boolean algorithms to identify genes associated with with neutrophil counts. 

Here is a brief summary of the files included:
<ul>
  <li>Neutrophil Analysis.ipynb: Notebook containing analysis and code to reproduce figures</li>
  <li>ViolinPlot.py: library for generating specialized plots</li>
  <li>neuAnalysis.py: script to load datasets used and analyze gene expression data (microarray and RNA-sequencing)</li>
  <li>percentile.cpp: efficiently calculate percentile expression scores for a gene</li>
</ul>

To run the code, please install our lab softwares <a href='https://github.com/sahoo00/Hegemon'>Hegemon</a> and <a href='https://github.com/sahoo00/BoNE'>BoNE</a>. The datasets analyzed can also be explored online in our <a href='http://hegemon.ucsd.edu/~rohan/Hegemon/explore.php?key=neu'>database</a> of over 30 neutrophil datasets.

A manuscript is under preparation and this computational analysis was used for a Curebound grant currently under review.
